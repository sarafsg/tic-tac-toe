# Tic-Tac-Toe (React Game)

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was built as part of my learning journey with React. I developed this project to gain hands-on experience with key React concepts, including state management, component structure, and event handling. The focus was to build an interactive and user-friendly web application while enhancing my understanding of React.

## Purpose and Usage

This project was developed as part of my study of React to strengthen my ability to build interactive UIs using React components and hooks. It also demonstrates how to manage state and update the UI in real-time based on user interactions, improving my skills in React and JavaScript.
